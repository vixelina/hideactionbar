# HideActionBar Mod
A Minecraft 1.8.9 Forge mod that lets you hide the action bar.
Default Hotkey: Ctrl+H

### What is the action bar?
It's where messages such as "You can only sleep at night.", "Now Playing: Music Disc" and so on appear.
I made this mod for the sole reason to hide the Mana, Health and Defence stats in Hypixel Skyblock, so it will hide those as well.
